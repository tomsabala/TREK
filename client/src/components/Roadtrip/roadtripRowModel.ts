/**
 * A road trip day, flattened into the rows a screen draws, with no React in sight.
 *
 * The rail builds its rows inline while it renders, which is fine for a panel that only
 * ever exists once. The phone draws the same chain in a second shell, and the two would
 * drift the first time a rule changed, and the duplication budget does not stretch to
 * the same forty lines of branching twice. So the branching lives here: what is a row,
 * in which order, and which of a stop's findings survives the two marks a 375px line can
 * carry.
 *
 * Deliberately free of React, translations and formatting. It answers "what is on this
 * line", never "how does it read", so it can be unit tested on its own and so the same
 * answer can be drawn twice in two different design languages.

 * needs one). So each figure is one the chain below repeats, and the start is the first
 * stop's ARRIVAL rather than the moment you leave it. A first stop is a place you get to,
 * often at a time somebody pinned, and heading the card with its departure hid that
 * appointment behind its own stay: a stop pinned at 10:00 with an hour and a half there
 * read as leaving at 11:30, a clock no row shows.
 *
 * A resume point is a start, because the morning after an automatic night begins there. A
 * day end point is not an arrival: it marks where the window closed, not a place. A spill
 * band is passed over, because the departure it carries belongs to the day before.
 *
 * Stops without a clock are skipped at both ends instead of dashing the figure. That only
 * happens while a leg between them and the timed stops has no route yet, and a partly timed
 * day still has a first and a last clock worth reading, even when both are the same stop's.
 *
 * First and last mean row order, not the earliest and the latest clock, because the column
 * is not guaranteed to run forwards. A pin the drive cannot make keeps its own clock, so it
 * can read earlier than the stop above it. And when a daily window cannot be kept, each
 * stored day is timed on its own without being split, so a card can open on an evening stay
 * and end on a pin the next morning. The figures follow the rows in both cases, so they
 * never name a clock the chain does not.
