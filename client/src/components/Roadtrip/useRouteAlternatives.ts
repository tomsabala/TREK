 * breaking up the single request `splitIntoRuns` bundles it into — the optimisation that
 * makes a road trip appear at once rather than trickle in.
 *
 * When the leg already carries vias, the road actually being driven is NOT among what the
 * router offers for the two bare endpoints — it was asked a different question. So it is
 * fetched separately and put at the top, marked as the current one. Without that, opening
 * the picker on a leg you have already reshaped shows you three roads, none of which is
 * the one you are on, and no way back to it.
