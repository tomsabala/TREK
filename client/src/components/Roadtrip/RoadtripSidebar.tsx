                band carries, because unlike those it is the one thing in the band worth
                pressing. What it does is in the tooltip and in the screen reader label.

                Once a search is open the lamp steps aside for the state that matters:
                the way to close the answer, or the way to ask again. An answer that
                found nothing leaves a button rather than a dead end — the place search
