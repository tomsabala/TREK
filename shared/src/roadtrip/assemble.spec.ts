/**
 * ROADTRIP-ASSEMBLE-001..005: what the assembler does with the model's warnings, and
 * what it tells a surface about the drive between connected days.
 *
 * The model itself is pinned by roadtripModel.spec.ts. This file pins the
 * wrapper, which is where the arguments are chosen: `deriveDriveWarnings` takes
 * a two-slot "does this stop refuel" pair, slot 0 for the stop the leg leaves
 * and slot 1 for the stop it arrives at, and the assembler hard-coded slot 1 to
 * false. The suppression the model was written for could therefore never fire
 * through it, so a day that stops at a charger 700 km in reported running dry
 * at the charger, and a run of warnings that should collapse to one did not.
